# Netflix-Rating-Analysis
A data analysis project exploring trends in Netflix’s global catalog using Python. Includes data cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis to uncover insights about genre distribution, release patterns, and content ratings. Tools used include pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

This project explores Netflix’s global content library through data analysis and visualization using Python. By cleaning and analyzing over 8,000 titles from the Netflix dataset, I identified trends in genre popularity, release patterns, and audience ratings.

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) with pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I learned that Netflix has steadily increased its production of international films and TV shows since 2015, with a major focus on dramas and documentaries. I also found that most content is rated TV-MA or TV-14, reflecting a shift toward mature audiences.

This project strengthened my skills in data cleaning, correlation analysis, and storytelling through visualization improving my understanding of how Netflix’s content strategy evolved over time.

Key Features:

Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline

Visual correlation analysis of ratings, release year, and genres

Outlier detection using standard deviation thresholds

Interactive plots for trend exploration

Technologies Used:
Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab
